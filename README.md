In this project, we will design and deploy a production-ready, multi-tier infrastructure on AWS leveraging Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management. This approach automates the deployment of the infrastructure and ensures that configuration management is streamlined and consistent across different environments. Letâ€™s dive deeper into the components of the project, the steps involved, and how each tool contributes to creating a scalable and reliable system.

## Overview of the Project

The primary objective of this project was to build a scalable, resilient, and automated cloud infrastructure on AWS. The solution included provisioning resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB tables in multiple environments (dev, prod, stage). Furthermore, we automated configuration management tasks like updating system packages, installing services (such as Nginx), and deploying content to the web servers using Ansible. The entire infrastructure and configuration were managed as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which made the environment repeatable, consistent, and easily scalable.

## This approach allows for:

Consistency: Reproducible environments across development, staging, and production.

Scalability: Easily add more resources (e.g., EC2 instances) without manual intervention.

Automation: Full automation of infrastructure provisioning and configuration management, reducing human error and speeding up deployment times.

Reliability: Automated deployment and configuration ensure that the environment is always in the desired state.

This setup is scalable and can be extended to more complex systems, such as multi-tier applications with databases, load balancers, and application servers.
